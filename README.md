and Neutral.
# DataSet
Dataset used was [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) and was taken from Kaggle. The dataset had
4 classes- Positive, Negative, Neutral and irrelevant. For this project, I have removed the rows with Irrelevant data.
